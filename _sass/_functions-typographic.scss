/**
 * Points (defined in pixels)
 * 
 * Reference: http://www.thomasphinney.com/2011/03/point-size/
 * 
 * The web can use points, but just defines them in terms of pixels. 
 * It has inherited the Windows definition of that ratio, so on the web by default 1 pt = 4/3 pixels, so 12 pt is equal to 16 pixels.
 *
 * But the relationship between pixels and points is broken in some browsers on Windows (such as Internet Explorer 7 and earlier) when the user has a non-standard resolution set.
