<div class="message rounded-border-4">I am a <strong>Digital Designer</strong> based in Adelaide, Australia.</div>

### Over the past few years
I have developed my digital media skills and capabilities around the integration of progressive technologies.  

I also have substantial involvement in analysing and using ICT systems, spreadsheets and workflow tools to facilitate production.

### Currently
My interests are User Experience Design, Content Management and Information Architecture.  

I am engaged in developing **full stack** software architecture skills using the [Node.js development platform](https://nodejs.org) and [functional reactive programming techniques](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming) to build scalable [isomorphic applications](http://nerds.airbnb.com/isomorphic-javascript-future-web-apps/).  

I am also writing [articles on digital design methods](https://medium.com/doing-digital).
