    <p><a href="http://www.oldandsold.com/articles10/trades-5.shtml">Traditionally, a compositor</a> is responsible for setting all the type of a book or document to be printed. They also prepare <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imposition">imposition formes</a> for the commercial printing process.</p>
    <p>In recent times, the Composing trade has become incorporated with the Graphic Reproduction trade and is now known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premedia">Graphic Pre-press/Pre-media</a>.</p>
    <p>These days, it involves managing, enhancing and incorporating visual media, including images and text content. Increasingly the content is prepared for digital platforms such as the world wide web, “apps” for mobile devices, digital signage and other screens. <a href="http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/i-dont-speak-your-language-frontend-vs-backend">Front end design</a> techniques are used to achieve some degree of interactive functionality by taking advantage of the dynamic nature of the digital medium. Digital interactive industry best practices are followed to allow for enhanced <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Content_Accessibility_Guidelines">accessibility</a> for people with impairments or disabilities.</p>
