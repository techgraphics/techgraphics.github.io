They also prepare <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imposition">imposition formes</a> for the commercial printing process.</p>
    <p>In recent times, the Composing trade has become incorporated with the Graphic Reproduction trade and is now known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premedia">Graphic Pre-press/Pre-media</a>. Pre-media encompasses the whole new world of multichannel media delivery.</p>
    <p>These days it involves managing, enhancing and incorporating visual elements, including images and text content. Increasingly the content is prepared for digital platforms such as the world wide web, “apps” for mobile devices, digital signage and other screens. <a href="http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/i-dont-speak-your-language-frontend-vs-backend">Front end design</a> techniques are used to achieve some degree of interactive functionality by taking advantage of the dynamic nature of the digital medium.
